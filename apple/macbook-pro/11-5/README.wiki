= Apple MacBook Pro 11,5 =

This configuration will '''not''' work with MacBook Pro 11,2 or 11,3 models.

The [https://support.apple.com/kb/SP719 MacBookPro11,4 and MacBookPro11,5] models ship with a discrete ATI graphics card (whereas MacBookPro11,2 and MacBookPro11,3 ship with NVidia cards). This is alongside the usual integrated Intel GPU.

You may wish to look into dynamic switching between integrated and discrete graphics, but this config doesn't attempt it.
